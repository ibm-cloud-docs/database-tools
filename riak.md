{: shortdesc}

Riak is an open source, highly scalable, fault-tolerant distributed database. It is different than traditional relational databases and other NoSQL nonrelational databases. Riak offers a number of unique benefits to users:

* Built to operate in highly distributed environments, such as the cloud.
* Master-less - it has no single point of failure.
* Fault-tolerant due to its distributed nature. You can lose access to Riak nodes, but never lose data.
* Makes data highly available for use in read and write-intensive web applications.
* Scales easily and intelligently. You can easily add a node to a cluster, with no downtime.
* Incredibly stable - many users see Riak as the "building blocks" of a cloud data infrastructure.
* Elegantly simple design makes for a smaller cost of operations.

{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} offers Riak in both the standard Riak and Riak Enterprise versions.
